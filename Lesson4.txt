Anyone will be able to provide liquidity to available bankrolls. Underlying liquidity providers will receive a share of revenue parallel to the bankroll increasing in size.Network ExpansionSince ZKasino focuses on ZK Rollups, its aim is to go live zkSync Era when a VRF becomes available. ZKasino can be expected to go live on StarkNet and Polygon zkEVM as well.Gasless BetsZKasino wants to offer the user the best and cheapest experience. Gasless transactions and thus gasless placing of bets are now possible through Metaplay. We will keep you posted when gasless bets become available.Play-to-Earn (P2E)Once ZKasino's token is live, ZKasino will offer Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming where betting will grant you ZKasino tokens.Permissionless bankrollsIn the future LPs will be able to permissionlessly create own bankrolls for ERC-20s of their choice and deposit liquidity into these non-custodial pools. This allows any ERC-20 to be a bankroll token (except deflationary tokens).Subsidised VRF feeGenerating randomness involves costs, so VRFs charge a fee for RNG requests. ZKasino aims to subsidise these VRF costs from the user's perspective, so the only thing a player has to worry about is the size of their bet.Gaming Software ProvidersCurrently, ZKasino is using its own software for the games. All code is written by ZKasino, contracts and frontend. In the future, gaming software providers could get integrated into ZKasino when software providers launch on the blockchain.Protocol UpdatesGeneral updates to the protocol planned for the future:Analytics dashboardReferral systemBonusesMore languagesMore soundsImprove graphics and add 3D graphicsChat boxSports bettingPrediction gamesCasino GamesAdd more casino games in the future:LotteryRouletteBlackjackBaccaratCrashDifferent slotsMulti-hand Jacks or BetterPvP GamesAdd PvP games in the future:Rock Paper ScissorsDiceTokenomicsA token is on the roadmap. More information will be provided in the future.GovernanceA DAO is on the roadmap. More information will be provided in the future.Future Partnerships and IntegrationsZKasino has already integrated two VRF projects, Chainlink and Randomizer. ZKasino also has a partnership with MatchboxDAO. In the future there will be more integrations, such as bridges, and more partnerships.TeamBy ZigZag Labs.PreviousZKasino Chain TestnetNextResponsible GamingLast updated 1 year ago
